Setup:

- Fork this project on Github 
- Modify `pull` and `push` scripts to point to a directory other than `ishaan`

Workflow:

1. Make some changes in the project directory (scripts, training data, whatever).
2. Use `push` to send the project directory to the server.
3. Run necessary commands via ssh.
4. Use `pull` to fetch any changed files from the server (e.g. rnnlib save files, log files, etc.).
5. Rinse and repeat.
